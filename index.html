        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>

        <p>
          <strong>Hello! I'm Angela,</strong> a full-stack software engineer
          based in NYC with a background in chemsitry.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a Master of Science in Chemistry with a concentration in
          Biochemistry from University at Albany, State University of New York.
          I also managed the General Chemistry and Quantitative Analysis
          Laboratories as a College Laboratory Technician and was an Adjunct
          Instructor for the Department of Sciences at John Jay College of
          Criminal Justice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to immersing myself into software engineering, I enjoyed
          spending time in the laboratory, running experiments, collecting data,
          and analyzing the results. When I started programming, I quickly
          realized that writing code to solve problems and developing my own
          applications involved the same steps as running an experiment. You
          have to identify the problem, form a hypothesis, run tests, and
          analyze the results. You make conclusions about the hypothesis or form
          another hypothesis. Similarly, you modify your code or design based on
          your analysis. Most times, I get the results from my code much faster
          than from my experiments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enrolled in the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy, a
          full-time immersive software engineering program. I learned to use
          different technologies and built some pretty cool applications with
          some pretty cool people from my cohort. I think that there are many
          ways to integrate my skills in chemistry research into software
          engineering. I am excited to apply what I learned to make a big impact
          while contining to learn and work with new technologies.
