          About Me
        </h3>

        <p>
          I am a full-stack software engineer based in New York City with a
          background in chemsitry.
        </p>

        <p>
          I earned my Master of Science in Chemistry from
          <a href="https://www.albany.edu/">SUNY Albany</a>. I managed the
          General Chemistry and Quantitative Analysis laboratories as a College
          Laboratory Technician and was an Adjunct Instructor for the Department
          of Sciences at
          <a href="http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/"
            >John Jay College of Criminal Justice</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to immersing myself into software engineering, I enjoyed
          spending time in the laboratory, running experiments, collecting data,
          and analyzing the results. When I started programming, I quickly
          realized that writing code to solve problems and developing my own
          applications involved the same steps as running an experiment. You
          have to identify the problem, form a hypothesis, run tests, and
          analyze the results. You make conclusions about the hypothesis or form
          another hypothesis. Similarly, you modify your code or design based on
          your analysis. Most times, I get the results from my code much faster
          than from my experiments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enrolled in the
          <a href="https://www.gracehopper.com/">Grace Hopper Program</a> at
          <a
            href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/software-engineering-immersive"
            >Fullstack Academy</a
          >, a full-time immersive software engineering program. I learned to
          use different technologies and built some pretty cool applications
          with some pretty cool people from my cohort. I think that there are
          many ways to integrate my skills in chemistry research into software
          engineering. I am excited to apply what I've learned to make a big
          impact while contiuning to learn and work with new technologies.

                  >Ricochet Robots</a
                >
                is a digital version of the board game of the same name. Players
                compete to find the shortest path for a robot to reach its
                target cell on a grid. Players can find the shortest path
                manually with the arrow keys or have the computer find the path!
                This project is a work in progress.

                  >Shelter-In-Pets</a
                >a is a mobile application that grew from the need to provide
                homes for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. A user can find
                their ideal pet by uploading a picture of a dog they like to the
                app's breed prediction model or search by selecting dog
                attributes. The user can learn more about a dog by viewing it.
                They can also contact the shelter via phone or email. The user
                can like a dog and view their liked dogs in the Favorites page.
                The app makes it even easier for the user to find their perfect
                pet with the Recommendation feature.
